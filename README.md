# Multiprocessor Programming

## Phase 1 - Installation of Environment and Self-Study

Phase 1 of the assignment focused on setting up the development environment for OpenCL programming, understanding the basic concepts of OpenCL, and ensuring the environment is properly installed and configured to run OpenCL programs.

## Phase 2 - OpenCL introduction. Matrix addition, filtering, profiling.

In the second phase of the assignment, the main objectives were to introduce OpenCL programming, carry out matrix addition, perform image processing tasks, and profile the code in order to compare the host and device execution rates. Establishing a time measurement and profiling framework, implementing matrix addition in both C/C++ and OpenCL, and carrying out image processing tasks in both environments were the objectives.

## Phase 3: Stereo disparity implementation in sequential single thread C/C++-code

Expected result: A simple but correct serial implementation using C/C++ code


## Phase 4: Stereo disparity implementation using in multi-threaded C/C++-code

Expected result: A C/C++ implementation that utilize more than one core of the CPU


## Phase 5:  Stereo disparity implementation using OpenCL for a GPU

Expected result: A simple but correct parallel implementation of the algorithm runnings on GPU
